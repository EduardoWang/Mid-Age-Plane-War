Description:
Mid-Age: Plane War is a historical SLG strategy game where the player will
develop economy and technology to build your own army to defeat the AI. Player
and AI will take turn to operate. Player will have a certain amount of gold and
you can decide to use them to train army or develop economy or technology. Based
on the history of Mid-age in Europe, there are four types of soldier can be
trained including infantry, cavalry, pike-man and archer and there is a cycling
restraint among them according to history. The goal is to conquer the enemy's
base. No matter how much army your enemy controls, as long as your army
successfully reaches your enemy's base, you will win this game and vice versa.
Smart combination of army and suitable timing of developing economy and
technology will be the key to success.
There is a UI.png file shows the game interface. The major part of the game is
happening in the checkerboard in the middle which is structured with 63 hexagons
with player's and AI's base. The up left part of the checkerboard colored in
blue is your base and the hexagons colored in light green are the territories
you own. The red part in the right bottom corner is the AI's base where your
goal is to conquer it. In the upper left corner of the page shows the four
types of soldiers to be trained with their counter relation beside. The top part
is a status bar which shows the gold you own, your current technology and the
gold required to upgrade. For example, Attack: 1/100 shows that your current
attack for each soldier is 1 and requires 100 gold. There are limitations for
upgrading attack and speed but not for gold. Notice that the gold you own will
not pass to the next round.

Operation:
In the player round, user can press different keys to get into several modes for
different purposes.
P: train mode (choose soldier type at the up left corner and enter the amount).
Q: confirm the number of soldiers to be trained.
