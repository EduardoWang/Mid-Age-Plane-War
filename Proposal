CMPUT 275 Project Proposal: Middle Age: Plane War

Description: The project is a Strategy turn-based Game. Two countries on a map with hexagon
lattices will fight with each other. Player can choose left side or right side of
the map to attack and defend computer. The goal of the game is to control the
different types of soldiers to expand territory and conquer the opposite country.
Every turn you will earn some money, you can use money upgrade or produced Soldiers
There are several kinds of soldiers like archer, saber, knights which deal
different damages. Each type of soldier can deal extra damages on another
specific kinds of soldiers. Player send Soldiers to the lattice on the map.
Then there will generate an area seen as territory of this country. The soldier
will go to that lattice with a path calculated by Dijkstra algorithm and it will
take some turns for soldiers reach the lattice. There are mists on the unoccupied
and enemy territories. Your army can detected mists of the six lattices around it.
Initially you will have several lighthouse on the map that can detected some area
and you will have a initial territory. The enemy have been detected will be marked
and can be seen all the time. The data of different soldiers will be stored using
AVL tree.
